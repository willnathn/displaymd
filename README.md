# What
Given some directory, serve all markdown files with a nav menu on the left and the markdown. On change reload.
Best case is it would automatically display consistent with your neovim config, but I only have 2 hours.

# Why
I want to expose my personal notes on code to my website. I use [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to sync between my devices, so just need to take markdown and convert dir structure -> nav bar then show the markdown.
